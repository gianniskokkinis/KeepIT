# KeepIt
**This is an app which i create to learn more stuff about java.**


This is a simple notepad to keep your notes clean and safe. KeepIt has simple functions like save, edit, open files, and more for organizing your thoughts. The unique function of the program is the exit button, I hope you don't need a whole day to find it. 



Have Fun!


# Tools
*Windows and Debian Linux only platforms support

*Java Version 8 


*Java Development Kit


*Command Prompt




# How to run the program

First of all, you need to download the folder KeepIt. If you working on windows platform, you can just open run.bat file script. If, you working from debian linux, you need to javac the *.java files and after run software with command "java PreMenu.java". I hope you like it and undestand the idea of the project. 

OF COURSE, I'm keep working on that project and is not finish yet. If you have any idea, i would like to head that and help me to finish this project. Thank you.
